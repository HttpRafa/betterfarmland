Better Farmland is meant to improve your experience with your farmland.
But there are also other functions for people who want something fancy.
If you have any suggestions for the plugin/mod, please use the [Discussion](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/better-farmland.566196/) function.

Plugin for [spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/better-farmland.103677/) or as mod for [fabric and forge](https://modrinth.com/mod/betterfarmland/)

For developers: If you want to extend my mod or make it compatible you can use my [repo](https://repo.rafa.run/).
